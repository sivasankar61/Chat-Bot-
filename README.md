# Chat-Bot-
This is a text-based chatbot built using Python with voice output support. It uses the pyttsx3 library for offline text-to-speech so the bot can not only reply in text but also speak its answers aloud.  The chatbot can answer personal, professional, fun, lifestyle, and feelings questions, recommend movies, tell jokes, and more.
